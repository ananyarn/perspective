# PERSPECTIVE (MY FIRST GITHUB REPO)

## 📁 My Practice Code Repository

Welcome! This is a personal repository where I store and organize my practice code as I learn and explore different technologies.

### 📌 About This Repo

- This repo started as a collection of my old Python files — small experiments and basic programs.
- I now use this space to store folders for whatever I'm currently learning, experimenting with, or revisiting.

### 🧠 Currently Re-learning

#### ➤ HTML & CSS
I'm following [Dave Gray's HTML Full Course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA) + [Dave Gray's CSS Full Course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R2E7O-Ngo) and building small projects and exercises from it. 


### 💡 Why This Repo?

- To keep track of my learning journey.
- To experiment freely without worrying about structure or polish.
- To reflect on how my code evolves over time.

### ✅ What's Next?

I’ll continue to add folders and code snippets as I:
- Re-learn core programming concepts.
- Explore web development, LLMs, and tools.
- Document what I’ve built or tried out.

*Thanks for checking out this repository!* ✨
